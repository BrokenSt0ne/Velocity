-[Possible Bug] Error with demo saving on Mac/Linux ?
-Save last level player was on, player times per level, levels the player has finished
-Play demo from file
-Play a premade list of movement commands

Levels:

1. Teach basic movement
	-turn camera with mouse
	-wasd to move
	-space to jump
	-hold space for continous jumping (faster)
	-ctrl to crouch

1.5 Seperate players
	-Normal platform
	-Extra platform (only accessible with air-strafing) -> skips tutorial

2. Teach air-strafing
	-Play a level without player control -> player sees fast gameplay and airstrafing
	-Play the same level, player only controls a and d, camera movement happens automatically -> player controls airstrafing for the first time
	-Play the level again, player now has to move the mouse while pressing a or d -> Airstrafing happens (this is the important part)
	-Play the lever for the last time, now with full player controls
